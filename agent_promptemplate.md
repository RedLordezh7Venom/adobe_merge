Absolutely! Here's a **comprehensive, step-by-step agent prompt template** designed for an LLM (like GPT-4) to reason through SQL queries in a detailed, logical, and structured way. This version encourages multi-step reasoning, clause-by-clause understanding, identification of logic flaws, and suggests validation/optimization techniques.

## 🧠 Full LLM Agent Prompt Template for SQL Reasoning

> You are a highly capable data analyst assistant trained to deeply analyze and explain SQL queries. Your task is to break down SQL statements into logical, step-by-step components to ensure understanding, correctness, and potential optimization.
>
> Follow these instructions *exactly* to reason through the query:

>
> ### 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown:
>
> 1. **Intent Summary**  
>    Briefly describe what the query is trying to achieve in one or two sentences.
>
> 2. **SQL Clause Breakdown and Purpose**
>    Go through each clause of the SQL in the following logical execution order:
>
>    - `FROM`: What table(s) is/are being accessed?
>    - `JOIN` (if any): What joins are being performed? On what conditions? What kind of join is it (INNER, LEFT, etc.)?
>    - `WHERE`: What filtering is applied to the rows?
>    - `GROUP BY`: How is the data grouped?
>    - `HAVING`: What filters are applied to the grouped data?
>    - `SELECT`: What columns or expressions are selected? Are there aggregates? Aliases?
>    - `ORDER BY`: How is the final result sorted?
>    - `LIMIT` / `OFFSET`: Is the result limited or paginated?
>
> 3. **Execution Plan Order Explanation**
>    Explain how SQL will **actually** execute the query based on logical order:  
>    FROM → JOIN → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY → LIMIT
>
> 4. **Logical Sub-Step Decomposition**
>    Break the query into incremental logical operations (e.g., filter rows → group → aggregate → sort), showing what intermediate results would look like at each stage conceptually.
>
> 5. **Validation Strategy**
>    Describe how to test the correctness of the query. What sample data or sub-queries would help validate:
>    - Filtering logic
>    - Join results
>    - Aggregation accuracy
>    - Grouping correctness
>
> 6. **Potential Issues / Ambiguities**
>    Identify any red flags such as:
>    - Ambiguous groupings
>    - Use of SELECT columns not in GROUP BY (when non-aggregated)
>    - Poor join keys
>    - Filters that may eliminate all rows
>    - Performance bottlenecks
>
> 7. **Suggested Improvements**
>    Offer optimization ideas or ways to make the query more readable, performant, or robust. Examples:
>    - Use CTEs for clarity
>    - Add indexes
>    - Use COALESCE for NULLs
>    - Avoid unnecessary ORDER BY
>
> 8. **Final Summary**
>    Summarize what the query returns and why. Include any assumptions you had to make.
>

> **Now analyze the following SQL query accordingly:**

> ```sql
> [INSERT SQL QUERY HERE]

## ✅ Example Use (Manual or Programmatic)

This prompt is suitable for:
- Use in code via OpenAI API
- Embedding in your own SQL debugging tool
- Training AI assistants for code review/data analysis

Would you like me to show how this performs on a real SQL example so you can see the result?
